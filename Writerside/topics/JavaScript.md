# JavaScript

%product% can execute JavaScript, just like Node.js, Deno, or Bun. Similar to other popular JavaScript runtimes,
%product% strives for Node API compatibility.

```Console
elide run --javascript ...
```
```Javascript
export default function hello() {
  console.log("Elide can run JavaScript!")
}
```

## Language Engine

%product% is an ECMA2023-compliant JavaScript engine. JS is the most mature language offered by %product%; execution is
powered by [GraalJs](https://github.com/oracle/graaljs), which ships with GraalVM.

| Language | **JavaScript**                                     |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Standard | ECMA2024                                           |
| Maturity | ![Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/-beta-purple) |

## Standards Conformance

Elide conforms to several JavaScript standards:

### WinterTC

Elide is a [WinterTC](https://wintertc.org)-conforming runtime; Elide supports the [Minimum Common API][0] and several
other WinterTC proposals or standards.

See our [WinterTC Conformance](WinterTC.md) page for more information.

### Node API

The [Node API](https://nodejs.org/api) constitutes the functions and modules provided by Node.js on top of V8; the Node
API is quite large and covers everything from assertion testing to zlib compression.

%product% aims for full Node API compatibility _where possible and applicable._ What does that mean? Well, %product% is
written on top of [GraalVM](https://graalvm.org) rather than V8, so immediately several Node API modules do not apply
(for example, the `v8` module).

Most Node.js applications and libraries only make use of a small surface area of the Node API. As [Bun](https://bun.sh)
and [Deno](https://deno.land) have shown, a great deal of software can run out of the box with sufficient
(but incomplete) Node API coverage.

> See Elide's [Node API reference](Node-API.md) for more information.

## Performance

Elide executes JavaScript with comparable performance to V8-based runtimes like Node and Deno, and JSC runtimes like
Bun. Although GraalVM is a completely different core engine, it is well suited for CLI and server use, whereas V8 and
JSC were architected with browsers in mind.

As a result, Elide can deliver very strong performance in JavaScript, especially for server-side use cases.

**[Elide is ranked highly on the TechEmpower benchmarks.][1]** At the time of this writing Elide holds the
**133rd position** for plaintext responses. Node & Deno, FastAPI & Django (Python), and many other popular frameworks
rank lower than this score.

## Glossary

JavaScript
: It's a software language I suppose.

Node.js
: It's a JavaScript runtime which is designed primarily for server-side use. Node.js embeds Google's V8 JavaScript
engine, the same available in Google Chrome.

Node API
: Suite of APIs provided on top of regular JavaScript, which, collectively, become Node.js. For example, if you're ever
imported or required the `fs` or `path` module, you've used the Node API.

ECMAScript
: Formal name for JavaScript, as defined by the ECMAScript Standard. JavaScript language versions are denoted as ECMA
years; for example, 'ECMA2023' includes JavaScript features up to the year 2023.
