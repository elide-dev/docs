# URL API

Elide supports the [WhatWG](https://whatwg.org) [URL API Specification](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/); this is the spec
you use when you use the global `URL` class in JavaScript.

Elide's implementation of `URL` and `URLSearchParams` are based on JDK 22's
[`URI`](https://docs.oracle.com/en%2Fjava%2Fjavase%2F22%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2F%2F/java.base/java/net/URI.html),
[`URL`](https://docs.oracle.com/en%2Fjava%2Fjavase%2F22%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2F%2F/java.base/java/net/URL.html),
and
[`URLDecoder`](https://docs.oracle.com/en%2Fjava%2Fjavase%2F22%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2F%2F/java.base/java/net/URLDecoder.html)
classes.

## Classes

[`URL`](#url) Parse and manipulate URLs
: ðŸŸ¢ Supported.

[`URLSearchParams`](#urlsearchparams) Parse and manipulate URL params
: ðŸŸ¢ Supported.

## `URL`

```Javascript
const url = new URL('https://google.com/search')
url.pathname  // returns '/search'
url.hostname  // returns 'google.com'
```

The `URL` class is used as a [value class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object) which wraps a standard
[Uniform Resource Locator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL), also known as a "URL". URLs have a specific structure and
suite of supported components, as opposed to their more general ancestor,
[URIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier).

URLs are strictly validated: when you construct one from a string, it is parsed eagerly, and you will get an error if
the provided string is not a valid URL.

URLs, by spec, support the following components:
